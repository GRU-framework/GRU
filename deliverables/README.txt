This is a set of files for a primary evaluation of the GRU tool.

GRU will be published as an open-source project  around September 2015.
As for April 2015 the project is not mature enough for publication.

To know more about GRU read the GRU_tutorial and whyGRU documents.

Examples cited in the tutorial are in the demos zip file.

To run gru you need: java 8, Groovy 2.4.3, the gru.jar and gruResources.jar
you can unzip gruResources.jar to modify it!

GRU has been developped under the IntelliJ IDEA : I'd be interested by feedback about installation on other IDEs.
(right now you need to write some Java code to run examples: sorry!)

For the moment the source code  is not published because it needs a lot of enhancements, tests and documentation.

Note for early adopters: your advice is important, my english is patchy (the doc and the choice of keywords may not be correct),
and the features need more evaluations before being "freezed".

Thanks for your advices.

Thanks to the developpers of: Java, Groovy, IntelliJ, asciidoc, vim!
